Error: ゲームの実行ファイルが見つかりませんでした - Game executable could not be found
---------------------------

- Check if other vpatch DLL files are in folder, i.e. vpatch_th**.dll or vpatch_alcostg.dll. Remove any extra DLLs.

- Check if path has a mojibake folder name, and rename if so.

- Check if file is actually named correctly. With a proper install this should never be the case, since vpatch uses the default filenames.

- If you do not have all file extensions visible ("Hide extensions for known file types"), you might be accidentally naming your game "th**.exe.exe".

Error: ƒQ[ƒ€‚ÌŽÀsƒtƒ@ƒCƒ‹‚ªŒ©‚Â‚©‚è‚Ü‚¹‚ñ‚Å‚µ‚½ - Game executable could not be found
---------------------------

- The same as the above error, but mojibake due to being run outside of the required Japanese locale. Switch your system to a Japanese locale or use a program such as Locale Emulator.

---------------------------
Error: ゲームの実行ファイルへのDLL Injectionに失敗しました - DLL injection of executable has failed
---------------------------

- Your path might have a folder name with characters that cannot be read properly, such as mojibake or foreign names. Rename the folder or move the game outside of this path.

---------------------------
Silent failure
---------------------------

- Check if game is updated to its latest version. Many Touhou games are not released on disc as their latest versions; vpatch will fail silently on these.
