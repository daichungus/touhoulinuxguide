VsyncPatch


With every newly installed patch, always make a backup copy of your score.dat files in case something weird ever happens. 
This is just a general rule. While I don't think this progam has ever caused any data (scores, history, etc) to corrupt or reset, 
It's always a good idea to keep a backup in case it does happen by other means.

Modify the [Window] parameters to suit your liking. You can run it windowed, and if so you can control the window width/height
as well as the position it appears on your screen and such. Pretty self-explanatory.

There are patches for some games in both revision 4 and 7. Use the latest version of the patch for each game.

Leave a copy of vpatch.exe, vpatch.ini and the corresponding dll file in your game folder.
Do not have more than one vpatch_th**.dll file in one folder, or else a conflict might occur and the game won't launch.

Rename each individual exe file to th**.exe, where the stars are the game number, except for EoSD and Uwabami Breakers, 
which must be named 東方紅魔郷.exe and alcostg.exe, respectively. Naturally this will be true by default, but if you want 
to run the english-patched game then you must rename the executable from th07e to th07, and so on.
EoSD must also be launched using AppLocale / Locale Emulator, or by setting your system to a japanese locale.

Start the game by launching vpatch.exe.
